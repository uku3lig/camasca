<h1 align="center">camasca</h1>

**camasca** is a small collection of packages and modules for personal use, and that I feel like shouldn't be upstreamed to nixpkgs (or that I am too lazy to package and maintain properly)

camasca exports both a flake interface (`packages.<arch>.<pname>` and `nixosModules.<name>`) and a default.nix (attrset of derivations)

_note: camasca is also available as a read-only mirror on [GitHub](https://github.com/uku3lig/camasca). original source repo can be found on my [forgejo](https://git.uku3lig.net/uku/camasca)_
